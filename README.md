# library_app

library_app is a web application that helps me to keep track of books.

## Getting started

These instructions will help you to get the application running on you local machine.

### Installing

#### What things do you need to install the software?

I would recommend any user of this software to have the newest version of Python running in my case that is Python 3.7.3. If that is not the case check out these great instructions: https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/chapter_01/osx_setup.html.

Besides Python I used an virtual environment and Flask 1.0.2. To set this up I can highly recommend this great tutorial: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/factory/. 

### Acknowledgments

Mostly I used the Flask Tutorial to set up the basics and then arrange it to my needs as best as possible. This holds true for most of the application except the HTML and CSS code.

The frontend got inspired by various examples for basic input forms as showed on this website: https://www.sanwebe.com/2014/08/css-html-forms-designs .
