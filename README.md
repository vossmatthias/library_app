# library_application

library_application is supposed to be a web application that helps me to keep track of my books.

## Getting started

### Prerequsites 

What things do I need to work with the library_application? 

It's pretty simple. I worked with Python 3.7.3 which I used to set up my database with SQlite. 
Additionally I used a Flask 1.0.2 to set a up my server.
